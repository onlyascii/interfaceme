# Interface Me

## Why?

Working in big organisations I found myself waiting other teams to respond on requested tasks while all processes were automated from my side. Then I wondered how can I automate this process fully without waiting? Should I create a really simple piece of software that people wont push back on installing? Hopefully you and I will find this useful.

## Todo / Features

[ ] Simple API for requests
[ ] Service discovery
[ ] High availability (Just to avoid my automation to fail)
[ ] Remote log but keep being stateless
[ ] Tests tests tests
